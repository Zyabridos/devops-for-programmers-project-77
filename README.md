# Terraform Web App Infrastructure

This project provisions infrastructure for a web application using **Terraform** and configures it using **Ansible**.  
It deploys [**my chat application**](https://github.com/Zyabridos/chat), containerized with **Docker** and hosted on EC2 instances behind a Load Balancer.

## What It Deploys

-   2 EC2 web servers (Ubuntu)
-   Docker + application container [zyabridos/chat:latest](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/zyabridos/chat/general)
-   HTTPS Load Balancer (Application Load Balancer)
-   PostgreSQL database (RDS)
-   Elastic IPs for each server
-   Security groups with ports 22, 80, 443
-   Fully automated provisioning and deployment pipeline
    
## Prerequesties

-   **Terraform** >= 1.3
-   **AWS CLI** configured with necessary permissions
-   **Make**
-   **Ansible** >= 2.15
-   SSH key (`~/.ssh/new_key` and `~/.ssh/new_key.pub`) for EC2 access

## Deployed Application
You can access the application here:
